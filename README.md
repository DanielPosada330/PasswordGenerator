# PasswordGenerator
The purpose of this program is to allow a user to generate a unique password of various lengths depending on the user's choice. 
The program then gives the user the option to save their generated password into a text file, or simply view it in the console.
## Motivation
I made this program as a way to start putting into practice the basics of Python that I had been learning during coursework.
This allowed me to get further experience utilizing conditional statements, try and except statements, debugging issues, while and for loops
just to name a few.
## Language
As stated previously, this code was written in Python to practice the syntax of Python
## Build Status
This was my first completed project that I was able to expand upon after looking for inspiration for a beginner project.
Although the program is simple, there are certain things I would like to expand upon in the future, most notably being able to add
additional passwords and save those to text files, but as well as assigning which "account" or "website" said generated passwords
would pair up with. Although the program works as intended, there is room for improvement and expansion.
